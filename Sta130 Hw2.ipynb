The first code (Prof. Schwartz's version) has a lot of lists and a complex logic, particularly when handling door choices and removals. try-except and delete() clauses, which make the code more difficult to understand and comprehend. Additionally, variable naming might be somewhat confusing; for example, the code becomes verbose when using secret_winning_door and all_door_options_list.\n",

    "  2. `next_word`: Tracks which words come after a given word and how many times each transition occurs (i.e., a frequency table for word transitions).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Initially, `defaultdict` was considered for ease of use, where the default value for `word_used` would have been `0` and for `next_word` a nested dictionary with default integer values. But here, normal dictionaries are used, so manual checks are required to initialize values.\n",
    "\n",

    "- This starts a loop over the list `words` (which presumably contains the words of the chatbot's dataset). The loop uses `enumerate` to get both the index (`i`) and the current word (`word`) in each iteration.\n",
    "- The slice `words[:-1]` means the loop will iterate over all words except the last one. This is because the chatbot is predicting the next word, so it needs to pair each word with the following one (thus no need to include the last word).\n",

    "```python\n",
    "    if word in word_used:\n",

    "```\n",
    "- This block checks if the current `word` has been encountered before:\n",
    "  - If the word exists in `word_used`, its count is incremented.\n",
    "  - If it's a new word, it is added to `word_used` with an initial count of 1, and an empty dictionary is assigned to `next_word[word]`. This dictionary will hold the possible next words and their counts.\n",

    "```\n",
    "- This part handles the tracking of transitions between words:\n",
    "  - It checks if the word following the current word (`words[i+1]`) is already in the `next_word[word]` dictionary.\n",
    "  - If it is, it increments the count, indicating that this transition (from `word` to `words[i+1]`) has been observed one more time.\n",
    "  - If it's not present, it adds the new transition with an initial count of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This code builds a Markov chain from a list of words (`words`), which could be sentences or conversations used by the chatbot. The chain works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`word_used[word]`**: Tracks how often a word occurs.\n",
    "2. **`next_word[word][next_word]`**: Tracks how often one word follows another.\n",

    "### **Detailed Summary of Each Code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Extension #1:**\n",
    "This extension enhances the chatbot’s Markov chain by introducing bigrams (two-word sequences) instead of single words. It tracks how often each bigram occurs (`word_used2`) and which words are likely to follow each bigram (`next_word2`). The use of bigrams provides better context when predicting the next word, which results in more coherent and contextually appropriate text generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Extension #2:**\n",
    "This extension adds character-specific tracking to the Markov chain model. It uses the `characters` dataset to distinguish between different speakers, creating separate bigram and word-transition dictionaries for each character (`word_used2C` and `next_word2C`). This allows the chatbot to simulate distinct speech patterns for each character, generating text that matches their unique style or dialogue history.\n",

    "\n",
    "This string of code appears to be part of a Markovian chatbot, where the chatbot is trained to generate responses based on patterns of word sequences found in the dialogue dataset `avatar`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of what the code does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Counting Characters in `avatar.character` Column:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   characters = Counter(\"\\n\"+ avatar.character.str.upper().str.replace(' ','.')+\":\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This line creates a `Counter` object from the `avatar.character` column. It:\n",
    "   - Converts all character names in the dataset to uppercase (`str.upper()`).\n",
    "   - Replaces any spaces in the names with dots (`str.replace(' ','.')`).\n",
    "   - Adds a newline character `\"\\n\"` at the beginning of the string and appends a colon `\":\"` after each character's name.\n",
    "   - The result is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each character name in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Defining Nested Default Dictionaries:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   nested_dict = lambda: defaultdict(nested_dict)\n",
    "   word_used2C = nested_dict()\n",
    "   next_word2C = nested_dict()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Here, the code defines a lambda function that recursively creates a `defaultdict` (dictionary that returns default values when a key is missing). The purpose of this is to create deeply nested dictionaries. Two of these structures are defined:\n",
    "   - `word_used2C`: This will store counts of word pairs used by each character.\n",
    "   - `next_word2C`: This will store counts of the third word that follows each word pair for each character, which is important for building a Markov chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Looping Through the Words:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for i,word in enumerate(words[:-2]):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This loop iterates through a list of words (probably from the dialogue in the `avatar` dataset). The loop runs from the first word up to the second-to-last word (hence the `words[:-2]`). For each iteration:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Checking if the Word is a Character Name:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     if word in characters:\n",
    "         character = word\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     This checks if the current word is a character name, based on the previously created `characters` dictionary. If it is, it assigns the word (the character's name) to the variable `character`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Tracking Word Pair Usage (`word_used2C`):**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     if character not in word_used2C:\n",
    "         word_used2C[character] = dict()\n",
    "     if word+' '+words[i+1] not in word_used2C[character]:\n",
    "         word_used2C[character][word+' '+words[i+1]] = 0\n",
    "     word_used2C[character][word+' '+words[i+1]] += 1\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     This block counts how often each word pair (i.e., the current word `word` and the next word `words[i+1]`) is used by the current `character`. Specifically:\n",
    "     - If the character doesn't have an entry in `word_used2C`, it's initialized as an empty dictionary.\n",
    "     - If the word pair (`word + ' ' + words[i+1]`) doesn't exist yet in that character's dictionary, it’s initialized to 0.\n",
    "     - The count for that word pair is then incremented.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Tracking the Third Word After a Word Pair (`next_word2C`):**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     if character not in next_word2C:\n",
    "         next_word2C[character] = dict()\n",
    "     if word+' '+words[i+1] not in next_word2C[character]:\n",
    "         next_word2C[character][word+' '+words[i+1]] = dict()\n",
    "     if words[i+2] not in next_word2C[character][word+' '+words[i+1]]:\n",
    "         next_word2C[character][word+' '+words[i+1]][words[i+2]] = 0\n",
    "     next_word2C[character][word+' '+words[i+1]][words[i+2]] += 1\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     This section works similarly to `word_used2C`, but instead of just counting word pairs, it counts the third word (`words[i+2]`) that follows each word pair for the character. This helps the chatbot model predict the next word in a sequence based on the previous two words. \n",
    "     \n",
    "     The structure looks like:\n",
    "     - `next_word2C[character][word + ' ' + words[i+1]][words[i+2]]`\n",
    "     - It counts how often the word pair (`word` and `words[i+1]`) is followed by `words[i+2]` in the character's dialogue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Purpose:\n",
    "The code is building two important structures:\n",
    "1. `word_used2C`: Tracks how often each word pair is used by each character.\n",
    "2. `next_word2C`: Tracks how often a specific third word follows each word pair for each character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these structures can be used to simulate dialogue by generating word sequences using a Markov chain. The chatbot could generate new dialogue for a specific character by predicting the next word based on the previous two words.\n",
